## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Cannot find module 'tailwindcss-animate'" error**
   ```bash
   npm install tailwindcss-animate
   ```

2. **Prisma enum errors with SQLite**
   - The schema has been updated to use string fields instead of enums for SQLite compatibility
   - Run `npm run db:generate && npm run db:push` to update

3. **Database connection issues**
   - Ensure the `.env` file exists with proper configuration
   - The SQLite database will be created automatically in `prisma/dev.db`

## Database Schema

The application uses a comprehensive database schema with the following main entities:

- **Users**: Members, coaches, and administrators
- **Classes**: Recurring class definitions
- **ClassSessions**: Specific instances of classes
- **Bookings**: Member reservations for class sessions
- **Attendance**: Check-in records for completed classes
- **MemberProgress**: Belt ranks and attendance tracking
- **Newsletters**: System announcements
- **Notifications**: Automated alerts
- **Settings**: System configuration

**Note**: All enum fields have been converted to string fields for SQLite compatibility.

## Security Features

- Role-based access control (Member/Coach/Admin)
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT-based session management
- API route protection with middleware
- Input validation with Zod schemas
